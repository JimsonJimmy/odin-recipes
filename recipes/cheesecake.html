    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Cheesecake is a rich, creamy dessert made from a smooth mixture of cream cheese, sugar, and eggs, all baked over a buttery biscuit or graham cracker crust. This indulgent treat comes in many varieties, from classic New York-style to fruit-topped, chocolate, and even no-bake versions. The texture ranges from dense and velvety to light and fluffy, depending on the recipe. Often finished with a luscious glaze, fresh fruit, or a drizzle of caramel or chocolate, cheesecake is a favorite for special occasions or a delightful sweet treat any time!

  <h2>Steps to Make Pizza</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Step 2: Make the Dough</h3>
      <p>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead for 5–7 minutes until smooth.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Step 3: Let the Dough Rise</h3>
      <p>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</p>
